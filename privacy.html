          <h3>3. Health Data Collection and Use</h3>

          <p>
            As part of Menalam's services, we collect health data to help provide personalized
            health and wellness recommendations, including supplements, diet plans, and fitness
            goals. This health data may include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Nutritional habits</li>
            <li>Supplement intake</li>
            <li>Activity levels and workout routines</li>
            <li>Health and wellness assessments</li>
            <li>Other health-related information as provided by you</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This health data is sensitive and will only be used to offer you relevant
            recommendations or services. We will not sell your health data to third parties or use
            it for advertising purposes without your explicit consent.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Third-Party Integrations</h3>

          <p>
            Menalam may integrate with third-party services, such as Apple Health or other
            health-tracking platforms, to collect additional data to help improve your health
            recommendations. These integrations will only occur with your explicit consent. The
            third-party platforms' terms and privacy policies apply to any information shared
            through these integrations.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Location Data Usage</h3>

          <p>Menalam may collect location data from your device in the following cases:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Health Data Collection from Android Devices</li>
            <li>
              Our app integrates with Google Fit and other health data sources that may require
              location permissions when retrieving activity-related information such as steps,
              distance walked, or calories burned.
            </li>
            <li>
              The location is used only for the purpose of syncing accurate health data from your
              device and is not stored or shared for any other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>Background Location Usage</li>
            <li>
              If your device settings allow, location data may be accessed in the background only
              when necessary to fetch real-time health metrics from Android’s health APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The app does not track, store, or share your location for advertising or any other
              purposes.
            </li>
            <li>User Control & Permissions</li>
            <li>
              You can manage your location permissions at any time from your device settings under
              App Permissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you deny location access, some features relying on health data synchronization may
              not function properly.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Notifications</h3>

          <p>
            We may send notifications to your device regarding health tips, new supplements, special
            offers, and updates on your account activity. By using the App, you consent to receiving
            these notifications. You can manage your notification preferences through the settings
            in the App.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Data Retention and Security</h3>

          <p>
            We take reasonable steps to protect your personal data using industry-standard security
            measures. However, no method of data transmission over the internet or method of
            electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means
            to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We retain your personal
            data for as long as needed to provide the services you request, comply with legal
            obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You can request the deletion
            of your data by contacting us through the settings in the App or by reaching out to our
            support team.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Service Providers: We may share your data with third-party service providers who help
              us operate our business (e.g., payment processors, hosting services). These providers
              are required to protect your data and may only use it for the purposes for which it
              was provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              Legal Compliance: We may disclose your information to comply with legal obligations,
              respond to lawful requests by public authorities, or protect the rights, property, and

            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
              Opt-out of Marketing: You can opt out of receiving marketing communications at any
