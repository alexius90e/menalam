          <h3>3. Nature of Recommendations & No Medical Advice</h3>

          <h4>3.1 General Information Only</h4>
          <p>
            Menalam is designed to provide general wellness information and suggest supplements that
            may be suitable based on the data you provide. Menalam is not a medical device and does
            not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with a qualified
            healthcare professional before making changes to your diet, supplements, or exercise
            routines.
          </p>
          <h4>3.2 Not a Substitute for Professional Care</h4>
          <p>
            No content or recommendations within Menalam should be interpreted as professional
            medical advice. The App’s suggestions do not replace in-person evaluations or
            recommendations from healthcare professionals.
          </p>
          <h4>3.3 Use at Your Own Risk</h4>
          <p>
            Your health decisions, including those related to supplements or lifestyle changes, are
            solely your responsibility. Menalam and its team disclaim all liability for any adverse
            effects or outcomes resulting from following any suggestions within the App.
          </p>

          <h3>4. How Menalam Works</h3>
          <h4>4.1 Personalized Supplement Suggestions</h4>
          <p>
            Menalam analyzes user-provided data (such as your age, health goals, and dietary habits)
            to recommend supplements that may support your health objectives. These recommendations
            are based on algorithms, expert insights, and publicly available research.
          </p>
          <h4>4.2 Third-Party Supplements</h4>
          <p>
            When you purchase supplements through the App, you are buying from third-party vendors,
            not Menalam directly. Menalam does not manufacture, test, or endorse any specific
            supplement brand and is not liable for their quality, claims, or side effects.
          </p>
          <h4>4.3 Notifications & Reminders</h4>
          <p>
            Menalam may send you notifications about supplement reminders, health tips, or updates.
            You can adjust your notification preferences in the App settings.
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>
            If you choose to purchase supplements or related products through the App, your payments
            will be processed by a secure third-party payment processor. Menalam does not store your
            payment details.
          </p>
          <h4>5.3 Refunds & Returns</h4>
          <p>
            All transactions, refunds, and returns are governed by the respective third-party
            vendor’s policies. Menalam is not involved in the fulfillment, shipping, or return of
            products.
